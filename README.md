Simple go backend using gin for counting opened apex packs since the last heirloom on a per user basis.

## How to run

First copy edit the env to run with your postgres database

```bash
cp .env_example .env
```

and edit it accordingly.

After that just run with

```bash
go run main.go
```

And hope it works.


Have fun!
